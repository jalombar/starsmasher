 tf=300, ! desired final time to stop simulation; use negative values if want to have code potentially change tf and/or skipahead
 dtout=1, ! how often an out*.sph files should be dumped
 nrelax=0, ! relaxation flag.  0=dynamical calculation, 1=relaxation of single star, 2=relaxation of binary in corotating frame with centrifugal force, 3=calculation in corotating frame with centrifugal and coriolis forces
 sep0=5, ! initial separation of two stars in a binary or collision calculation
 rp=0.7, ! WAS CALLED bimpact BEFORE - periastron separation
 vinf2 = 0.0 ! PARABOLIC COLLISION
 ngravprocs=2, ! the number of gravity processors (must be <= min(nprocs,ngravprocsmax))
 ppn=16, ! set this to the number of cpu cores per node
