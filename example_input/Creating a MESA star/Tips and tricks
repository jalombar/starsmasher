# How to make a rotating star 


You can make your star rotate. To do that, add inside your sph.input file the line:
omega_spin=N

Where N is the angular velocity of your star. To decide the correct number to put, we have to done a little calculation.
If you want, for example, that you star do exactly ONE rotation (2π) in ONE day of simulation (54 times of unit in Starsmasher,
that equals to 1 day)
N will be:

2π/54 =0.116             then  

omega_spin=0.116


If you want 2 rotations in 1 day, then the equation is 4π/54=0.29 ;     then omega_spin=0.29

If you want 1 rotations in 2 days the the equation is π/54=0.058;      then omega_spin=0.058

At the end just relaxe your star, after 200 time units it's ready to use it in a collision! If you notice, your star during the relaxation
is rotating!
