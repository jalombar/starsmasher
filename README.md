# StarSmasher - a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code.

Please contact Jamie Lombardi (jamie.lombardi@allegheny.edu) with any questions. 

You can also contact Francesco Radica (Francyrad.info@gmail.com) for installations and visualizing data problems. 

## Overview
StarSmasher (originally StarCrash) is a hydrodynamics code developed originally by Rasio (1991), updated and maintained as described in Lombardi et al. (1999), Faber & Rasio (2000), and Lombardi et al. (2006). 
_SPH_ is a Lagrangian particle method that approximates a continuous fluid as discrete nodes, each carrying various parameters such as mass, position, velocity, pressure, and temperature. 
In an SPH simulation the resolution scales with the particle density, and StarSmasher is able to handle both equal-mass and equal number-density particle models.

StarSmasher solves for hydro forces by calculating the pressure for each particle as a function of the particle's properties - density, internal energy, and internal properties (e.g. temperature and mean molecular weight).
The code now implements variational equations of motion and libraries to calculate the gravitational forces between particles using direct summation on NVIDIA graphics cards as described in Gaburov et al. (2010b). 
Using a direct summation instead of a tree-based algorithm for gravity increases the accuracy of the gravity calculations at the cost of speed (Gaburov et al. 2010a). 
The code uses a cubic spline (Monaghan & Lattanzio 1985) for the smoothing kernel and an artificial viscosity prescription coupled with a Balsara Switch (Balsara 1995) to prevent unphysical interparticle penetration. 
The code also implements an artificial relaxation force to the equations of motion to add a drag term to the calculated accelerations during relaxation integrations.

We are working hard to make tutorials and further documentation to make the code more user-friendly as possible. There is also documentation for Starcrash, which is a previous version of this [code](https://legacy.ciera.northwestern.edu/StarCrash/).
Although Starcrash is not the same as Starsmasher, the variable names, input files, output files, and parallelization strategy is very similar.
The Starcrash documentation is available as the file usersmanual.pdf in the misc subdirectory and may be somewhat helpful to peruse.
You will be most interested in pages 31 - 36, which talks about input and output.
Remember, however, that this Starsmasher SPH code is different in many ways.
The algorithms of Starsmasher are mostly described in [Evghenii et al. (2010)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.402..105G).
The AV scheme is described in Ponce et al. (2011).

## Installation

## Tutorials
[Star-star fly-by calculation](https://github.com/jalombar/starsmasher/blob/master/documentation/walkthroughs/star_star_flyby.md)
You will also find some tutorials in the [example_imput](https://github.com/jalombar/starsmasher/tree/master/example_input) folder, for example how to create stars and use it to make collisions.

## Publications using StarSmasher
The first iteration of StarSmasher appeared in 1991, used to study the collisions of giant stars with compact objects.
Since then, StarSmasher has been used to perform a variety of hydrodynamical calculations from common-envelope evolution and collisions in  galactic clusters involving binary stars at various stages and compact objects, and more recently, planet-planet collisions in Kepler Multis.

## DATA VISUALIZATION
I recommend Price's SPLASH software (Price 2007).
The tutorial to visualize SPLASH is present in the StarSmasher repository in a folder called "Data_visualization"
